The code aims at enabling retailers to use 'OLA now' Toggle key on their websites and provide customers seamless exprierence while shopping. This will have a progressive impact on customers, retailers and on OLA Cabs.
When a customer clicks on the toggle key, it automatically fills in the data for him to visit the retailer in person. On one side the retailer gives a better customer experience & the customer is being provided with a better shopping experience, while on the other side OLA cabs is being advertised on their website.
 
The retailer can incorporate this option using a user friendly integration tool where all he has to do is enter his retailâ€™s credentials. A HTML code is generated for the data provided and he/she can incorporate it with ease.
 
So this code will help OLA reach out to a vast majority of the society and vice-versa.
